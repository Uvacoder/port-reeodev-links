design","url":"blog/EE4213#introductions","content":"Somehow you may see various membership applications from daily life ranging from Yuu, Mee, KFC etc. Yet, a functional membership application should enable users to collect shopping points, history, news and other retail related actions. From my perspective of all membership applications, “Moneyback” is one of the great designs that fulfill Norman's principles with balancing the user experiences and design units. A normal membership application should apply the functions of generating a member QR code or related recognition patterns for retail machines to scan the code. In which, the functional part is the page of the member code that displays a QR code and related information. To interact with the pages, users are required to open the apps, click on the icons that represent the membership code to enter the page. While users open the pages, shopperkeepers or cashiers can be scanned through the QR code to input the members' information. After a successful payment, users may see that their points increased from their members page. In terms of membership applications, you may experience that graping your phone from your pocket, unlocking the screen and finding the target apps is a time consuming action. Once you open the apps, an extra step is to find out where your member's QR code is located. "},{"title":"Visibility​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#visibility","content":"By using the principle of visibility, the interface should be designed as simple and efficient once the application is open and ready to use. To state that Moneyback is adapting a great design that even considers the cases of majority users are time consuming to start up their phones and selecting the apps. As a result, the time of users finding members' code can make the queue time longer and annoy the queueing customers. To solve the issues, they make their applications landing page as the membership QR code page and light up the screen by default to save time from finding codes and lower the chances of unsuccessfully scanning the phone screen. The high visibility gain the advantages of out performances other members applications with consider the usage of majority customers. "},{"title":"Mapping​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#mapping","content":"As other terms of mapping, a fact of vast users are right handed and a researcher figures out that users will be focused on their fingers movement of the left bottom. The common function and icons are focused on the left thumb as a convenient way for users to press and click. We may observe that this app arranges their important or commonly used functions on the left bottom side rather than top and right.  "},{"title":"Affordance​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#affordance","content":"The Affordance of the apps gain users to press the related function as to icons clues rather than plain text. As the left figures, you may realize that even if you do not understand Chinese, you may have some clues that the related icon belongs to certain actions or pages. The application provides various icons and images for users to know what, where and when they press. As a result, certain icons make the applications usage at a low ease of learning and common phone users can adapt the using method in a short time.  "},{"title":"Simplicity​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#simplicity","content":"To care for the minority customers that do not know how to use smartphones probably (especially enderly for considering a part of the users are not ideal for using modern technology), they added a constraints principle of simplicity with the function of current applications by adapting a simplified version. Users would be able to perform complex functions within this interface, but instead of the disadvantages, they know most of the customers would not use all functions and only a few common functions are used daily. The adaptations of the simplified version help customers to access the target function in an efficient way. Without extra steps and utility, users would not perform wrong tasks.  "},{"title":"Feedback​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#feedback","content":"A state that the feedback regarding the applications is not perfect due to certain buttons is lack of indication within a click or press. Yet, the screen is fast enough to react from user interaction. But as users may misclick the button or the press actions is invalid, I suggested that all interaction icons and buttons may add a on-hover or on-press / on-click animations while the static icon and pressing icon are displayed with different opacity. "},{"title":"Consolutions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#consolutions","content":"As a consolutions regarding the applications, we may observe that a good design should stand in the users' considerations. Once you consider the customers' needs and usage, a good design can be made through the process.

This paragraph focuses on UI / UX rather than internal design and technical issues. "},{"title":"Introductions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#introductions-1","content":"As a management portal, the main task is to perform school related actions from selecting lectures section, payment, timetable or other related actions. It is important that students and staff can be able to do certain actions in a few clicks and find their related href. For example, if a student wants to register for an EE4213 course, they need to press the navigation of “course registrations” and select the button of “Main Menu for Web Add/Drop”. Then, they should find the CRN code in the “Master Class Schedule” at the EE department. After they obtain the code, students enter the code in the “Add or Drop Classes” CRN input box. If a submission is successful, they may see the course is registered in the timetable. To state that the system is not a bad design from the perspective of functional components and performing certain actions, there are several principles that the system can display in a better way. "},{"title":"Constraints & Affordance​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#constraints--affordance","content":"In terms of constraints and affordance, we may observe that several options may appear from your screen that you are not able to use. If you are an undergraduate, you can perform the below actions. In contrast, you can perform the top actions if you are a doctorate student. The logical constraints explain that if that action does not belong to us, then it should not appear in the interface. The system should hide the options that do not belong to the target roles to make the interface more simple and reduce invalid input.  "},{"title":"Mapping & Visibility​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Good design and Bad design","url":"blog/EE4213#mapping--visibility","content":" For the mapping principle, humans' reading priority is from the top to bottom, left to right in majority countries and language systems. Hence, to catch users' eyes, they should put the important and common items from top to bottom and make it simple to find. In pages like “Student Services” or “Staff Services”, no patterns or certain order can be found from the pages. As a result, the visibility of each page is not ideal. Users need to involve an amount of time to find the target href. Both mapping and visibility is below expectations. To improve the system, I might suggest using the below design.

The importance of using several color boxes and icons may make the interaction patterns more recognizable within box position. Humans tend to recognize graphics and colors rather than plain text. Using the sensations of visuals, we can establish the feedback by certain box reactions and click effects.
