From my perspective of all membership applications, \u201cMoneyback\u201d is one of the great designs that fulfill Norman\'s principles with balancing the user experiences and design units.  \\n\\nA normal membership application should apply the functions of generating a member QR code or related recognition patterns for retail machines to scan the code. In which, the functional part is the page of the member code that displays a QR code and related information. To interact with the pages, users are required to open the apps, click on the icons that represent the membership code to enter the page. While users open the pages, shopperkeepers or cashiers can be scanned through the QR code to input the members\' information. After a successful payment, users may see that their points increased from their members page.  \\n\\nIn terms of membership applications, you may experience that graping your phone from your pocket, unlocking the screen and finding the target apps is a time consuming action. Once you open the apps, an extra step is to find out where your member\'s QR code is located.  \\n\\n### Visibility\\nBy using the principle of visibility, the interface should be designed as simple and efficient once the application is open and ready to use. To state that Moneyback is adapting a great design that even considers the cases of majority users are time consuming to start up their phones and selecting the apps. As a result, the time of users finding members\' code can make the queue time longer and annoy the queueing customers. To solve the issues, they make their applications landing page as the membership QR code page and light up the screen by default to save time from finding codes and lower the chances of unsuccessfully scanning the phone screen. The high visibility gain the advantages of out performances other members applications with consider the usage of majority customers.  \\n\\n\\n### Mapping\\nAs other terms of mapping, a fact of vast users are right handed and a researcher figures out that users will be focused on their fingers movement of the left bottom. The common function and icons are focused on the left thumb as a convenient way for users to press and click. We may observe that this app arranges their important or commonly used functions on the left bottom side rather than top and right.  \\n  \\n![hotMap photo](./chrome_pvZFkBzTRB.png)    \\n\\n### Affordance\\nThe Affordance of the apps gain users to press the related function as to icons clues rather than plain text. As the left figures, you may realize that even if you do not understand Chinese, you may have some clues that the related icon belongs to certain actions or pages. The application provides various icons and images for users to know what, where and when they press. As a result, certain icons make the applications usage at a low ease of learning and common phone users can adapt the using method in a short time.  \\n\\n![apps imternal photo](./chrome_POiqrX8zEi.png)     \\n\\n### Simplicity\\nTo care for the minority customers that do not know how to use smartphones probably (especially enderly for considering a part of the users are not ideal for using modern technology), they added a constraints principle of simplicity with the function of current applications by adapting a simplified version. Users would be able to perform complex functions within this interface, but instead of the disadvantages, they know most of the customers would not use all functions and only a few common functions are used daily. The adaptations of the simplified version help customers to access the target function in an efficient way. Without extra steps and utility, users would not perform wrong tasks.  \\n\\n![apps simple mode photo](./chrome_mITCynR3tA.png)  \\n\\n### Feedback\\nA state that the feedback regarding the applications is not perfect due to certain buttons is lack of indication within a click or press. Yet, the screen is fast enough to react from user interaction. But as users may misclick the button or the press actions is invalid, I suggested that all interaction icons and buttons may add a on-hover or on-press / on-click animations while the static icon and pressing icon are displayed with different opacity.   \\n\\n### Consolutions\\nAs a consolutions regarding the applications, we may observe that a good design should stand in the users\' considerations. Once you consider the customers\' needs and usage, a good design can be made through the process.  \\n\\n## Bad design : Cityu Aims  \\n\\n![apps photo](./chrome_4BQKBpFlUt.png)    \\n\\n**Disclaimer**: I know that this is an old system and a legacy code is complex to maintain and add new features. This paragraph focuses on UI / UX rather than internal design and technical issues.  \\n\\n### Introductions\\nAs a management portal, the main task is to perform school related actions from selecting lectures section, payment, timetable or other related actions. It is important that students and staff can be able to do certain actions in a few clicks and find their related href. For example, if a student wants to register for an EE4213 course, they need to press the navigation of \u201ccourse registrations\u201d and select the button of \u201cMain Menu for Web Add/Drop\u201d.  Then, they should find the CRN code in the \u201cMaster Class Schedule\u201d at the EE department. After they obtain the code, students enter the code in the \u201cAdd or Drop Classes\u201d CRN input box. If a submission is successful, they may see the course is registered in the timetable.  \\n\\nTo state that the system is not a bad design from the perspective of functional components and performing certain actions, there are several principles that the system can display in a better way.  \\n\\n### Constraints & Affordance  \\nIn terms of constraints and affordance, we may observe that several options may appear from your screen that you are not able to use. If you are an undergraduate, you can perform the below actions. In contrast, you can perform the top actions if you are a doctorate student. The logical constraints explain that if that action does not belong to us, then it should not appear in the interface. The system should hide the options that do not belong to the target roles to make the interface more simple and reduce invalid input.  \\n\\n![aims nav photo](./chrome_kqMq6w8Bqj.png)     \\n\\n### Mapping & Visibility\\n![aims nav2 photo](./chrome_CMz1OWte6T.png)    \\nFor the mapping principle, humans\' reading priority is from the top to bottom, left to right in majority countries and language systems. Hence, to catch users\' eyes, they should put the important and common items from top to bottom and make it simple to find. In pages like \u201cStudent Services\u201d or \u201cStaff Services\u201d, no patterns or certain order can be found from the pages. As a result, the visibility of each page is not ideal. Users need to involve an amount of time to find the target href. Both mapping and visibility is below expectations. To improve the system, I might suggest using the below design.  \\n\\n![aims design photo](./chrome_gDgHzr5DyJ.png)  \\n\\n### Original code\\n```html\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n    <td class=\\"mpdefault\\"><a href=\\"/pls/PROD/hwosstudmgt_cityu.P_Main\\" class=\\"submenulinktext2 \\"><img src=\\"/gengifs/hwggbbal.gif\\" alt=\\"Blue ball graphic\\" class=\\"headerImg\\" title=\\"Blue ball graphic\\" name=\\"Blue Ball\\" hspace=\\"0\\" vspace=\\"0\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"10\\" width=\\"10\\"></a></td>\\n    <td class=\\"mpdefault\\">\\n    <a href=\\"/pls/PROD/hwosstudmgt_cityu.P_Main\\" class=\\"submenulinktext2 \\">Student Helper and Campus Internship Scheme</a>\\n    </td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n    <td class=\\"mpdefault\\"><a href=\\"/pls/PROD/hwssapgrd_cityu.P_Congregation\\" class=\\"submenulinktext2 \\"><img src=\\"/gengifs/hwggbbal.gif\\" alt=\\"Blue ball graphic\\" class=\\"headerImg\\" title=\\"Blue ball graphic\\" name=\\"Blue Ball\\" hspace=\\"0\\" vspace=\\"0\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"10\\" width=\\"10\\"></a></td>\\n    <td class=\\"mpdefault\\">\\n    <a href=\\"/pls/PROD/hwssapgrd_cityu.P_Congregation\\" class=\\"submenulinktext2 \\">Confirmation of Commencement Attendance</a>\\n    </td>\\n</tr>\\n...\\n\\n<tr>\\n    <td class=\\"mpdefault\\"><a href=\\"/pls/PROD/PCRS.P_CRS800\\" class=\\"submenulinktext2 \\"><img src=\\"/gengifs/hwggbbal.gif\\" alt=\\"Blue ball graphic\\" class=\\"headerImg\\" title=\\"Blue ball graphic\\" name=\\"Blue Ball\\" hspace=\\"0\\" vspace=\\"0\\" border=\\"0\\" height=\\"10\\" width=\\"10\\"></a></td>\\n    <td class=\\"mpdefault\\">\\n    <a href=\\"/pls/PROD/PCRS.P_CRS800\\" class=\\"submenulinktext2 \\">Mental Assessment Corner</a>\\n    </td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n```\\n<CamputRedesign/>\\n\\n### Functional code\\n```jsx\\nimport React from \'react\';\\nimport Grid from \'@mui/material/Grid\';\\nimport Box from \'@mui/material/Box\';\\nimport Card from \'@mui/material/Card\';\\nimport CardContent from \'@mui/material/CardContent\';\\nimport Typography from \'@mui/material/Typography\';\\nimport Container from \'@mui/material/Container\';\\nimport { FaCrosshairs, FaHammer, FaLandmark, FaLock, FaHome, FaUserPlus } from \\"react-icons/fa\\";\\n\\nconst iconSize = 50\\nconst dataArrJob = [\\n    { title: \\"Student Helper & Internship\\", icon: <FaCrosshairs size={iconSize}/> },\\n    { title: \\"Commencement Job \\", icon: <FaHammer size={iconSize}/> },\\n    { title: \\"JobPlus Vacancies\\", icon: <FaLandmark size={iconSize}/> },\\n]\\n\\nconst dataArrStudent = [\\n    { title: \\"Locker\\", icon: <FaLock size={iconSize}/> },\\n    { title: \\"Residence\\", icon: <FaHome size={iconSize}/> },\\n    { title: \\"Student Volunteers\\", icon: <FaUserPlus size={iconSize}/> },\\n]\\n\\nfunction SingleBox({ data, bgColor }){\\n    return (\\n        <Card sx={{ \'&:hover\':{ opacity: [0.8, 0.8, 0.7] }, width: 150, height: 150 , backgroundColor: bgColor , color:\'white\', display:\'flex\', alignItems:\'center\', justifyContent:\\"center\\" }} style={{ textAlign:\\"center\\" }}>\\n            <CardContent>\\n                { data.icon }\\n                <Typography Typography variant=\\"subtitle1\\">\\n                    { data.title }\\n                </Typography>\\n            </CardContent>\\n        </Card>\\n    )\\n}\\n\\nfunction RowList({ title, data, bgColor }){\\n    return (\\n        <>\\n        <h2>{ title }</h2> \\n        <Box sx={{ flexGrow: 1 }}>\\n            <Grid container spacing={2}>\\n                { data.map ( v => (<Grid item md={3} xs={3}> <SingleBox data={v} bgColor={bgColor} />  </Grid>) ) }\\n            </Grid>\\n        </Box>\\n        </>\\n    )\\n}\\n\\nexport default function CamputRedesign() {\\n    return (\\n        <Container maxWidth=\\"xg\\" style={{ marginTop: \\"30px\\" }}>\\n            <RowList title=\\"Jobs related\\" data={dataArrJob} bgColor=\\"#A50C5F\\"/> <br/>\\n            <RowList title=\\"Student Services\\" data={dataArrStudent} bgColor=\\"#6385C5\\"/><br/>     \\n        </Container>\\n    );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\nBy using a different design, we may find the target icons are more visible. The importance of using several color boxes and icons may make the interaction patterns more recognizable within box position. Humans tend to recognize graphics and colors rather than plain text. Using the sensations of visuals, we can establish the feedback by certain box reactions and click effects.  \\n\\n### Feedback  \\nThe feedback regarding the system is quite decent for any invalid actions. For any href that does not belong to the user\'s role, the system will alert messages of forbidden warnings instead of nothing. Any success request or click may output the regarding messages.  \\n\\n### Consolutions\\nRather than the design, the aims system is fully functional but lacks simplicity with new users. For new students and staff, it is quite hard to adapt the site without seeking other help or documents. It would be great if the interface can be better with a UI refresh design to make the system more usable to newcomers and common users."}]}')}}]);
